This is a 75% keyboard, exactly the [Vortex Race 3](https://mechanicalkeyboards.com/shop/index.php?l=product_detail&p=3917).

And why do I post about it? Because it's the layout for my brand new Ajazz AK33
keyboard which I'm testing while writing this post. 

What's special with this layout? Well, I'm very used to it because is the one on
my Dell Inspiron 5523. As you can see in the picture It have all the keys except 
for the number keypad but arranged in a more compact way.

So, when deciding which mechanical keyboard to buy, the safe choice was this. So far, the typing experience is very good: I am getting used to the sound and the tactile feedback. But yes, it feels good! Very different from my laptop keyboard or the external Logitech I bought and never used (impossible for me).

Really I was scared. I wanted a more compact layout (there is 60% and even 45%)
but the abscense of arrow keys was the thing that stopped me. 

Let's see if I'm more brave next time.

With you, the Ajazz AK33:
