### Travis Gould (Director of Product Management, Freedom Financial Network)
> Over the past year plus I have had the privilege of working with Gabriel as a developer on the Scrum team which I lead as the Product Owner. 
Between my Six Sigma work and my time in Product Management (20+ years combined), I have worked with a great number of developers, and Gabriel is amongst the very best I have worked with in terms of balancing back-end efficiency with elegant front-end user solutions. His ability to create high-quality UI functionality in a legacy system with a great number of pre-existing limitations has been superb.
In addition to the technical abilities Gabriel brought to the team, his personality, humor, and optimism were a bright spot in every day that I interacted with Gabriel. He has been an incredible asset to our team and I (along with the rest of the team) will miss him and wish him well in the next journey. 
Any team that is fortunate enough to have Gabriel with them is a lucky team indeed.
